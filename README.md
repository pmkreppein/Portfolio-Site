Personal/Portfolio website for Pete Kreppein.  Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.  Makes use of the 
Bootstrap framework for styling and Chart.js library for the pie chart.  I wrote a custom jQuery plugin for the smooth
scrolling on the resume page, that is available at github.com/pmkreppein/smooth-scroll.  Feel free to report any bugs/errors, thanks 
for visiting!
